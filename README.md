# **Rock Paper Scissors Game**

This project is a responsive, interactive implementation of the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" game. Users can play against a computer opponent and see the results of each round displayed in real time.

## **Features**

- **Dynamic Gameplay**: the game allows users to select their choice (rock, paper, or 
  scissors) and immediately displays the result of the match (win, lose, or draw).

- **Scoreboard**: tracks the player's and computer's scores throughout the session.

- **Visual Effects**: winning, losing, or drawing triggers unique visual glow effects for an 
  engaging user experience.

- **Responsive Design**: the game layout adjusts for optimal viewing and interaction on both 
  desktop and mobile devices.

- **Accessible UI**: clear labels and simple interactions ensure ease of use.

## **Technologies Used**

- **HTML5**: provides the structure of the web page.

- **CSS3**: enhances the aesthetics with custom fonts, animations, and a responsive design.

- **JavaScript**: powers the game logic and interactivity.

## **How to Use**

1. Open the project in any modern web browser.

2. Click on one of the choices: rock, paper, or scissors.

3. The game will display the computer's choice, and the round result, and update the 
   scoreboard.

4. Keep playing and see how high you can score!

## **Project Structure**

- **HTML**: the game's structure is defined in *index.html*.

- **CSS**: styling and responsiveness are handled in *styles.css*.

- **JavaScript**: game logic and interactivity are implemented in *main.js*.

## **Visuals**

- **Header**: displays the title "Rock Paper Scissors".

- **Scoreboard**: shows the current score of the user and the computer.

- **Choices**: users can select their move by clicking on the corresponding image (rock, 
  paper, or scissors).

- **Results**: provides feedback on the outcome of each round.

## **How It Works**

1. The user clicks on a choice (rock, paper, or scissors).

2. The computer randomly selects a choice.

3. The game compares the choices to determine the result:

   - Rock beats scissors.

   - Scissors beat paper.

   - Paper beats rock.

4. Scores are updated, and the corresponding visual effects are displayed.

5. The game continues until the user refreshes the page.

## **Responsive Design**

The game is fully responsive and includes specific adjustments for devices with a screen width of 767px or less:

   - Smaller font sizes and padding for the scoreboard.

   - Reduced dimensions for choice images.

   - Optimized layout for touch interaction.
